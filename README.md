### Line Follower using PID to make it more efficient.

#### The project consists of two folders:
  1. Line Follower Code: this folder includes three files.
  
      * `motor.c`: it has initialization for PWM to control the speed of a motor.
      * `main.c`: it has a calculation for PID and control of the robot.
      * `Inc.h`: it is a header file to combine `motor.c` with `main.c`.
  2. Line Follower Simulation: it has a simulation for a whole system with PID and PCB Layout. 
  
      * **note**: switches in the simulation is alternative to sensors.
